requires  RAILS  >=  2.3.3
( there're some differences in  belongs_to_association.rb between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3.  
2.3.3 makes life simpler, and it newer, so I decided to write version compatible with it... )


plugin wasn't tested with non-standard naming ( different than rails default table names, foreign keys, etc...)
so most probably it won't work in this case.  

queries which includes id field in conditions are forbidden after at_changelist(cl).
so, for example this query will give wrong output:

User.find_by_name('karol').at_changelist(5).cars.find(:all, :conditions => { :id => 4..10 } )

but this is ok:
User.find_by_name('karol').at_changelist(5).cars.find(:all, :conditions => { :color => 'red' })

only conditions with primary key after at_changelist are BAD
